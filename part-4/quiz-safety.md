When you run a command in the terminal, where does BASH look for that command? 
\n\n
A: Bash looks for commands in the default path

On a UNIX computer, how do you stop a running process? A: ^c ('control-c') stops a running process that is in focus (i.e. not running in the background). Some apps require, like node.js require you hit ^c twice to quit.

What packages do you have installed via homebrew? 

A: git, hub, icu4c, mysql, node, openssl, openssl@1.1, postgresql, readline, wget 

NOTE: This is a new machine so I have not reloaded all the packages I had on the old machine.  I have only reloaded what I needed for the new LG program.
