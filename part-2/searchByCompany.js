// searchByCompany.js takes one string argument (let's call it company), finds all the clients from clients.json who have a company that starts with the company string, and prints the id, company and phone of each matching client.
// Your searches should not be case-sensitive: i.e. a search for "Boston" is the same as a search for "boston".
