// searchByCity.js takes one string argument (let's call it the city), finds all the clients from clients.json who have a city that exactly matches the city, and prints the id, rep_name, company, city, and state of each matching client.

// Your searches should not be case-sensitive: i.e. a search for "Boston" is the same as a search for "boston".
